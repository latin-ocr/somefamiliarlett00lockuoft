one who values you more than 1 do, or
does more interest himself in all your con·
cerns. This makes me, that tho'lhavealong
time extremely defired to see you, and pro-
pose to my self an infinite satisfaction in
a free conversation with you3 yet what
you tell me, that you were coming last sum-
merintoEngland, to make mea vifit‚ makes
me dread the satisfaction of my own wishes·
And methinks Iought not to purchase one
of the greatest happineffes Ι can propose to
my sel-f at so dear and dangerous a rate. I
have received many and great obligations
from you before, but they were such, as
though I had no title το, 1 thought Ι might
accept from one whom Ι love, and there·
fore was glad to find kind to me. Eut when
Irefle& on the length of the way, and the
sea between us, the danger of the one, and
the fatigue of both, and your no very ro-
bust constitution, as 1 imagine, I cannot
consent you should venture so much for
my sake. [f any harm should happen to you
in the Journey, Icould never forgive it my ·
self to be the occafion of so great a loss to
the world and my self. And if you should
come safe, the greatness of the hazard, and
an obligation out of all proportion ‚ to
what I either ought to receive, or was ca-
pable to return ‚ would overwhelm me .

with ssiame, and hinder my enjoymgntd.

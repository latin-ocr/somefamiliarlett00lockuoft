De ar Sir, Ome ‚.3 Mamy169 7.
Hou gh the honour 5011 do me in 'the
value you put upon my shadow be
a fresh mark of that stiendffiip which 15 so
'grea t an happiness to me, yet Ι shall never
confider my pieture in the same house w ith
yon, without great regre't at my so far di-
stance from you my self. ’ But· I wiss not
'continue to importune you with my Com-³ ’
plaints of that kind3 'tis an adv antage
greater than I could haze hop ed, to have
the conversation of such a friend, though
with the sea between3 and the remaining
little scantling of my life would be too hap-
py if Ι had you in m) neighbourhood.

Ι am glad to hear that the gentleman you
mention& in 501155 of the oth. of the last
mouth, does me the favour to speak wel}
of me on that fide t'he water, Ι nex er deser
ved other of him,- but that he should always¹
hav e done so on t’his„v If his exceeding great
value of himself do not deprije the 55 orld of
that usefulness'‚ that his* pa'rtS, if rightly

§.mondue’ced might be οΙ,’ Iss'mfl be very glad·
He 55 ent from λαπάρη- 35 Ι heard after-
marcis, soon after I left it the last time.
But he did me not the favour tov give me a‘
visit whilst Ι was there , nor t‘o let me

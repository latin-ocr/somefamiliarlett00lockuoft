Mr. Locxss to Μν. ΜοιΥΝευΧ,

S Ι R, omes, April 26. 1695.

YOu look with the eyeS‚ and speak the
language of friendlhip‚ when you
make my life of so much more concern to
the world, than your own. Ι take it, as it
is, for an effec‘t of your kindnes5‚ and so
{hall not accuse you of complement3 the
mistakes and over-valuings of good will be·
ing always smeere, even when they exceed
what common truth allows. This on my
fide, I must beg you to believe, that my
life would be much more pleasant and use·
ful to me, if you were within my reach,
that Ι might sometimes enjoy your conver-
sation, and, upon twenty occasmm, lay my
thoughts before yon, and have the advan-
tage of your judgment. Ι cannot complain
that Ι have‘ not my {hare of friends of all
rank5‚ and such, whose interest, affistance,
affestiom and opinions τοο, in fit casea, I
can rely οη, But methinkS, for all this,
there is one place vacant, that I know no
b‘ody that would so well fill as your selfi,
Ι want one near me to talk freely with, de
quolibet ente3 to propose το, the extravagan-
cies that rise in my mind ‘a one with whom
‚1 would debate several doubts and questi·

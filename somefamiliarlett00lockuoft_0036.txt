writing of that subject, where I was very
apt to suppose distin& species Ι could talk
of without nameS. For pray‚ Sir, consider
what it is yon mean when yousay, that we
csm no more doubt of asparrow’s being a bird,
and an horse's being a hergli, than we can of
this colom being black, and t’other white, &a
but this, that the combination of fimple i,
deas which the word bird stands for, is to be
found in that particular thing we call a spars-
row. And therefore Ihope I have no where
said, there is 720 such sort of creatztres in na-
ture aa· birds3 if I have, it is both contrary
to truth and to rny opinion. This I do say,
that there are real constitutions in things
from whence these fimple ideas fiow, which
we obscrv'd combined in thern. And this
lfarther say, that there are real distinctions
and differences in those real constitutions
one from another3 whereby they are di-
stingniihed one from another, whether we
think of thern or name them or no, Eut
that that whereby we distinguish and rank
particular substances into forts or genera and
species, are not those real effences or inter-
nal constitutions, bnt such combinations of
fimple ideas as we observe in them. x This
I deiign’d to shew in Liii. ao, If, upon
your perusal of that chapter again ‚ you

not to any body else3 you may give it to
whom you please‚ for 'tis yours assoon as
you receive it, but pray do not give it to a·
ny body in my name, or asa present-- from
me. And however you are pleased to make
me a compliment‚ iu making me theanuthor
of a book you think well of, yet you may
be sure Ι ¹do not own it to be mine, till you
see my name to it,¹ , · , ,

You, I see, are troubled there ⁴about
your money, as well as we are here,- tho',
1 hope, you are not so deep in that «disease
as we are. A little before his Majesties re-
turn, the Lords Justices here had this mat-
ter under confideration, and, amongst orbem,
were pleased to send to me for my thoughts
about it. This is too publickly known here,
to make the mentioning of it to you appear
vanity in me. The paper I here inclose
would. seem a strange thing, did I not tell
you the occasion of my writing it. And,
since some of my friends here persuade me,
it gives some light to that, which the states-
man you mention, thinks so profound a
mystery. Ι have taken the liberty to÷ send
it you ‚ either to open that matter a little
further to you, or that you may shew me
the mistakes and defiet-”ts of it. But, pmy,
whatever use you make of it, conceal my
name.

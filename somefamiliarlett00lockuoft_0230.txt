Mr. [σακε to Mr. Motvnssux.

Dear Sir, Cares, 15. June 1697.
Have the honour of your two obliging
letters of the 15th. and 27th. of May,

wherein I find the same mind, the same af-
fection, and the same friendship‚ which
you have so frankly‚ and so long, made me
happy in. And, if Ι may guest, by the· pa-
ragraph which you transcribed out of your
friend’s letter into yours of the 15th. of
May, I shall have reason to think your
kindness to me is grown infefflom, and
that by it you fascinate your friends under-
standing5‚ and corrupt their judgments in
my favour. ‘Tis enough for me, in so un-
equal a match, if mighty truth can keep me
from a shameful overthrow· If I can main·

tain my ground, 'tis enough, against so re- ἱ

doubtable an adversary‚ but victory I must
not think of. I doubt not but you are con·
vinced of that by this time, and you will
see how filly a thing it is for an unskssl’d
pigmy to enter the lists with a man at πῶς,
versed in the use of his weaponS.

My health‚ and bufineffes that I like as ,

little as you do those you complain of ,
make me know what it is to want time. Ι -
often resolve not to trouble you any more
with my complaints of the distance between

ωε,

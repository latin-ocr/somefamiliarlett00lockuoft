Ι writ to you from L0nd0n‚ just as I was
leaving the town in haste, in answer to
yours of the second instant. You must par-
doti the faults of that to the hurty and di-
sturbance Ι was then in. I am not much
more at leisure, or at quiet, now, but
ihame will not suffer me to be filent any
longer, under the obligation of two other
letters Ι have by me of yours unanswer’d.

I cannot read yours of the 24th of August
last, without finding new marks of your
kindness to me, in the concern you therein
express to get a good hand for the transsaa
ting my Effay. Ι think , at last, you
have got a better than Ι could have expe&-
ed. I defigned to have brought ΜΓ. Chztr=
chill and him together, and settled that mat-
ter before Ι left London·³ but Ι was so‘unex-
peetetssy called thence, that Ι left that and
several other bufiness'es undone. Butl took
order With Mr. Chmchill, myb'o'okseller, to
go to him3 he is a reasonable man, and,
I doubt not, but it will be* taken car'e of,
as well as if I were there. I think the a·
bridgment is near, if not quite printed, but
I had not the time or memory to enquire‚
after my hasty summons into the country.
I was told t00, when I was in town, that
some body is printing against it3 if it be a
fair enquirer Ι shall be glad, if a wrangling

disputant, 1 ffiall not mind Ilgim. Mr

One thing Ι must needs infist on to you,
which ie, that you would think of obliging
the world , with A Trearise of Morals,
drawn up according to the hints you fre·
quently give in your Effizy‚ of their being

But then the talk must be undertaken only
by so clear and distinet a thinker as you
are. This were an attempt worthy your

ffonfideration. And there is nothing I
should more ardently wilh for, than to see
it. And, therefore, good Sir, let me beg
of you to turn your thoughts this way·7
and if “ so young a friendship as mine have
any force, let me prevail upon you.

taken with it, that when I was in London‚
in Auge-st 1690, I made enquiry amongst
some of my learned friends for any other
pf your writings (if perhaps they knew a·
ny) 1 was recommended by some to Two
Discomses concerning Government, and 8 lit-
tle Treatise concerning Toleration. There is
neither of thern carries your name, and 1
will not venture to ask whether they are
yours or not: This, only, 1 think, no
name need be alhamed of either.

Dr. Sibehw, 1 find, is your friend, and
therefore I affure him of all service I can

poffibly do him. I will {uage it my ῑέὲίζῐέ

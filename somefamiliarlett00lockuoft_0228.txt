upon me·⁷ and I cannot find fault with my
little boy’s progress under him. When I
formerly made enquiry from you about
Mons. Le (llere, I was in some prospe& of
providing for this gentleman whom I now
have, by the favour of a good friend, who
is fince dead. So that, at present, having
no opportunity of dispofing of him to his
advantage, I cannot conveniently part with
him. However‚ I do not know how soon
it may be otherwise 3 and therefore be plea-
sed, in the mean time, to let me know
something farther of Mons. Casta», as whe-
ther he be a complete master of the latin
tongue‚ or other language3 whether a ma⁴
themaricjran, or given to experimental <phi-
losophy3 what his age, and where educated.
AS to the Belles Latrat, l'Hq'stoire, &Q
Mons. Le Clerc has mention’d them already
in his charaeter.

I am mightily pleased to find that some
others have the same thoughts of Mons. 1,-
as you and I. His performances in mathe-
maticks have made the world mistaken in
him. But certainly in other attempta l am
of yomr opinion ‚ he no more understands
};}‘r1self‚ than others understand him.

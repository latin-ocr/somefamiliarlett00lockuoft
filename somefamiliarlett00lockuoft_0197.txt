ces. But, notwithstanding these difficula.
tie-5, I have ventur’d to break this matter
to a clergy-man here in a considerable post
Dr. Dean of ‚ a gentleman
who is happy in your acquaintance, and is a
person of an extensive charity, and great can-
dor. He relilh’d the thing extremely, but
moved the foremention'd difficulties, and
raised some farther scruples concerning Mr.
Le Clerc's ordination·⁷ for ordain'd he must
necessarily be, to capacitate him for :m ec-
=clesiastical preferment3 and he question'd
whether he would submit to those oatl]S‚
and subscription of affent and consent that
are requifite theretO. But he promised me,
that when he attends the King this summer
into Holland, as his chaplain, he will walt
on Nlons. Le Clerc at Amsterdam, and dis·
course with him farther about this matter,
This gentleman is the likeliest ecclesiastick
in Ireland to effect this businesS, for he is a
rifing man in the doureh, and tho' he be ve-
ry zealous in his own principle5‚ yet ’tis
with the greatest charity and deference to
others3 which, I think, is the true spirit
of christianity. Ihave not mention'd you
,in the least to him in all this matter.

Iam extremely obliged to you for the
good offices you have done me to Mr. Meth-
win our Lord Chancellon, Ι promise my

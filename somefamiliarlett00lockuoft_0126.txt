in earnest to it. There is one thing 1
would offer,· which may be of advantage to
him and the work t00, and that is, :that he
would constantly and seduloussy read Tully‚
especially his philosophical wmks, which
will insenfibly work him into a good latin
stile. Ι have heard it reported of Bp. San-
derson, that being asked how he came to
write latin so well, as appears in the treati-
ses he publiffied in that tonguez, he an-
swer'd, by ordering his studies so, chat he
read over all Tully’s works every year. I
leave it to you, whether you will think fit
to mention this to ΜΓ. Μηῖίαντ.

The ahridgment of my Effay is quite fi-
nish'd. It is done by a very ingenious man
of Oxford‚ a master of artS, very confide-
rable for his learning and virtue, who has
a great many pupils. It is done with the
same defign you had in view, when you
mention’d it. He has generally (as far as
I could remember) made use of my words3
he very civilly sent it me when it was done,
and, upon looking it over, Iguess you will
approve of it, and think it well done. It
isin Mr. Clamchill'shand5‚ and will be prin-
ted as soon as the third edition of my Effiy,
which is now in the prese, is printed off.

I am extremely glad tohear that you
have found any good effeels of my method
on your son. Ι should be glad to knoliv

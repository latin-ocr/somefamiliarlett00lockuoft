csteem, so Ι should have a more particular
regard coming from your self‚ as a private
memorial of my dear brother's friend, and
of a person for whom Ι have such an ex-
traordinary value‚ as I shall ever be proud
of owning my sels,

SIR‚

Your truly qffec‘lionace,

and humble servant,

THO. Mo LYNEUX.

Mr. LoeKE to Dr. Mormmx.

S Ι R, Oates 25. Jim. 1692.
Have been ssower in returning you my
‚ thanks for the favour of your letter of
the 25fh of Nm. and the civilities you ex—
press to me in it, thau perhaps I should have
been. But the truth ie, my thoughts never
look towards Dublin now, without casting
such a cloud upon my mind, and laying
such a load of fresh sorrow on me for the
loss of my dear friend your brother, that I
cannot without displeasure turn them that
way}

kinsman of yours3 and though his other·
good qualities might have made him wel—
come any where, he was not, you may be
sure, the less welcome to me, for being
known and related to you. He seems to
me to have been very diligent and curious
in making observations whilst he has been
abroad, and more inquifitive than most of
our people that go into those parts„ And
by the discourse Ι had with him, the little
time we were together, Ipromise my self we
{hall have a more exa& account of those ρει-ῖς,
in what Ι hope he intends to publilh, than
hitherto is extant. Dr. Huntingcon, who
was formerly at AleppO, and is my old aca
quaintance, and now my neighbour in this
country, brought Mr. Smich hither with
him from his house⁶ But yet Ι must aca
knowledge the favour to you, and desire
you to thank him for it when he returns to
Dublin. For the friendship he knew, you
had for me, was , Ι take it, the great in-
ducement that made him give himself the
trouble of coming fix or seven miles in a
dirty country.

You do so attack me on every fide with
your kindness to my book, to me, to my
shadow, that Ι cannot but be asham'd I am
not in a capacity to make you any other ac-
knowledgement, but in a very full and deep

sense of it. 1 return you I{ny thankss ror

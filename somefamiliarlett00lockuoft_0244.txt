fellei· tells me, is out of print, and I had
much rather be at leisure to make some ad.-
ditions to that , and my Effay of Humane

not foi-get your wishes, and shall acquaint
him with the observations you mention⁶
And the key you desire Ι thal! send you, if
it be fit to be aiked of him, which Ι am at

present in some doubt of. ⁴ Th

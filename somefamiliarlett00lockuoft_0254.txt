to you for reme'mbrmg me amongst your·
other friend5‚ whenever you are pleas'd to
oblige the learned world with any of your
happy thoughts, I had no sooner perused
them, but they were snatch’d out of my
hands by my lord chawnos, (so covetous
are all men of whatever comes from you)
and he has them yet. .

Amongst the other small craft that ap-
pears against you, Ι meet with one J. H.'s
State of England in relation to Coin ancl
Trade. I hear the author's name is Hodges.
He is much of a class in this particular as
Mr. Serjeant in relation to your Effizy, that
is, both tome unintelligible.

The inclosed is a sample of what this
place produces against you ε Ι wish you may
not say, that it resembles our mountains
and bogs in being barren and ,useless I
have ventur’d to send you my [hort answer'
thereto z, for a longer Ι think it did* not de-
serve. Ι have not seen the bishop fince·
this has pass’d 3 but we are so good friendS,
that this business will cause no anger bes
tween us, Iam

Your 77chle obliged humbl‘e servant,
Wr 121„ Mo 1„ v NE ως

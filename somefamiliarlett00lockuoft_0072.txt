found judgmeht, that convinces and delights'
at once. And Ι protest, Sir, 'tis to me the‘
hardest tasst m the w orld‚ to add any thing

deii ¹·ve1 therein3 every thing you writes
therein is deltx er ’d with such convincmg
reason, that I fully affent to all. And to
make remarks where I have no room to'
say any thing, would please neither you nor*
my self. And to snew you that I would
not wholly rely on my own examinatior] of

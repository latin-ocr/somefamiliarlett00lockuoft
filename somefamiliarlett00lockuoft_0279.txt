Dear Sir, omes, 6 April. 1698:¹ ’
Here is none of the letters that ever

Ι receiv'd from you gave me so much
trouble as your last of March 15‘h. I was
told that youmresolv'd to come into England
early in the spring, ‘and lived in the hopes
of it more than you can imagine. I do not
mean that I hadggreater hopes of it than
you can imagine 5¹ but it enliven’d me, and
'contributed to the support of my spirits
more'than yousscan think. · Eut 'your let-
t'erj 'has quite ‘dejected me again( The
thing I above 311 'things “long for is to
see, and embrace‚ and have some dis-
course with you before I go out of this
world. I meet with so few 'capable of
truth.‚ or worthy of a free conversation,
such as becomes lovers- of tuith, that you
cannot think it strange if I wissrfor some
time with you for the exposing, fifting,
and 'rectifying of my thought5.' If they
have gone any thing farther in the discovery
of 'truth than what I have already pub-
lissam, it must be by your encouragement
that I must go on to finith some 'things tha't
vIv have already begun, and with' you I hop’d
to discourse my other yet crude and imperfect
thoughtS, in which if there were any thing

useful

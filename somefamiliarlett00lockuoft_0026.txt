endeavouring something on that subjest. ,
Good Sir, let me renew my requests to you
therein‚ for believe me, Sir, ’twill be one of
the most useful and glorious undertakings
that can-imploy you, The 'touches you
give in many places of your book on this
subje& are wonderfully curious‚ , and do
largely testifie your great abilities that way,
and I am sure the pravity of mens morals
does mightily require the most powerful
means to reform them. Be as large as 'tis
poffible on this subjeet, and by all means
let it be in engliih. He that reads the 45
fection in your 129 page will be inflamed
to read more of the same kind from the
same incomparabie pen. Look therefore on
your self as obliged by God almighty to un-
dertake this tassr Qardon me Sir that I am
so free u ith 3 ou as to infist to your self on
your duty, w ho doubtless understand lt bet-
ter than Ι can tell you) suffer not therefore
jour thoughts to rest till you have finiffi’ d

it, and G vond almigh ’(3 sueceed your laboum,
is and shall be the pra) er of,

Your intirely {qffi‘it‘ionate

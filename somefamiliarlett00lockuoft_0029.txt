to your bookseller in London to be convey’d
to you. It is a general history of the air,
which though left by him very imperfeet,
yet I think the very defign of it will please
you, and it is cast into a method that any
one'who pleases may add to it, under any
of the several titleS‚ as his reading or obser-
vation shall furnish him With mattter of
fast. If such men as you are, curious and
knowing, would join to what Mr. Boyle had
collested and prepared, what comes in their

‘ way, we might hope in some time to have

a considerable history of the air, than which
Iscarce know any part of natural philoso-
phy would yeild more variety and use3 but
it is a subjedst too large for the attempts of
any one man, and will require the affi-
stance of many hands to make it a history

very {hort of compleat.
Since I did my self the honour to write

to your brother Ihave been very ill, to which
you mustpardon some part of the length of
my filence. But my esteem and resne& for
you is founded upon something so much be>-
yond complaint and ceremony, that 1 hope
you will not think me the less s0‚ though Ι
do not every post importune you with re⁰

peated professions that Ι am,

TO THE

READER.

. H Ε following Letters offer’d

Ι to your perusal are the genuin

. produfflions of those Gentlemen

polite conversation as friendfhip produ-
ces among men of parts, learning, and
candour3 bnt several matters relating
to literature, and more particularly to

cerning Human Understanding2 ancl in
some of his other works .· And therefore
I cannot doubt of your thanRs for the
present I make yon. Por tho' the cn-
rio zty of some to see whatever drops’
from the pens of great nien, and to in-
form themselves in their private cha.-
ratfiiers, their tempers2 dispositions and
manner of converfing.with their friends,

would perhaps have justify’d me in

Mr. Mommssnx to Mr. LocKE.

Dublin, March 16. ¹69³}-

Must confess, dear Sir, Ι have not late-
Ι ly (if ever in my life> beeen under a
greater concern than at your long silence.
Sometimes Ι was angry with my seff, but l
could not well tell why·³ and then Ι was
apt to blame you, but Ι could less tell why.
As your filence continued, my distraction
encreased3 till, at last, Iwas happily relie-

’ ved by yours of the 2 2d. of February, which

came not to my hands till the loth. instant.
I then perceived Ι was to charge some part
of my troubled time to the conveyance of
your letter, which was almost three weeks
oh its way hither. And that which added
’τὸ my concern, was the want of even your
(badow before me, for to this moment Ι
heve not received that, which will' be apt,

· on 'its appearance, to make me an idolatef. ,

Mr. Howard writes me word, he has sent
it fro‘tii London above five weeks ago3 but I
hear nothing of it from our correspondent
to whom ’tis configned in Chester, Howe-
- ver, seeing I know the substance to be in
safety‚ and well, I can bear the hazard of
the [hadow with some patience, and doubt
not but my expectation will be satisfyed in

due time.

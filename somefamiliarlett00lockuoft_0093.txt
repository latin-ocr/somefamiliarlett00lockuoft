Ι was mightily pleased to find therein a ra-
tional account of what I have often won-
der’d at, viz. Why men should content them-
sslves το (lay in this Iffe for ever, th0'‚ ac* the
same time, they will grant, that in the next:
lifi’ they expe& to be irfinitely‘ happy ,ἒ ’ of
this you give so clear an account *in the
44th. fection of your xxi. chapter book ΙΙ.
that my wonder no longer remainS. That
candid receffion from your former hypothe-
fis, which you ihew in this chapter, where
truth required it, raises in me a greater o·
pinion (if poffible> of your worth than e-
ver. This is rarely to be found amongst
men, and they seem to have something an-
gelical, that are so far raised above the com·
mon pitch.

In time Ι ‘shall give you my farther
thoughts of the other parts of your book,
where any thing occurs to me. But, at
present, Ι can only pour out my thanks to
you for the favourable character under
which you have transmitted me to posterity‚
pag. 67. My only concern ie, that 1 can
pretend to none of it, but that of your
friend3 and this I set up for in the highest
degree. I should think my sels happy, had
I but half the title to the rest.

I am extremely obliged to you for the
trouble you took on you jn my last reqncst,

about a tutor for my son.G I received lyour

Mr. MoLYNEth to Mr. Loexn,

Most honour’d deat Sir, Dubl. Apr. 19. 16983
Have formerly had thoughts of coming
I into England‚ as Ι have told yon, on oc·-
cafion of my healtln But fince the receipt
of yours of Apr. 6. which came to my hands
but this morning, that consideration weighs
but little with me. The defire of seeing
and converfing with you has drown-’d all
other expe&ations from my journy‚ and
now I am resolv’d to accomplish it, iet
what will come on’t. Your persuafions and
arguments I'think have something in them
of incantation ε Ι am sure their charms are
so powerful on me on all occafion5‚ Ican
never [refist them. Ι shall therefore em-
brace yon, God willing, as soon as ever the
parliament of England riseS. I fix this pe-
riod now, not so much in expestation of
our chancellor's arrival, as on another ac-
count. My dear friend must therefore
know, 'that the confideration of what Ι
mention'd in my last, from the incompa-
rable author of the Treatifh, δίς. has mo-
ved me to put pen to paper‚ and commit
some thoughts of mine on that subje& to
the press in a small SVO, entitul'd‚ The Cafe
. of Ireland’s being bound by Ac‘ls of Par-lia·
ment in England, stated. This you'll fay

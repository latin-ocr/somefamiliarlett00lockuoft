in chap.18.lib.iv.1 conceive it to be no
other than a religious sort of madnesS, and
comprises not in it any mode of thinking or
operation of the mind, different froin what
you have treated of in your Effay. ’Tis
true indeed, the absurdities men embrace,
on account o’f religion, are most astonishing·
and if in a chapter of Enthqfiasm you endea-
vour to give an account of them, ’twould
be very acceptable. So that (oi) second
thoughts) Ι do very well approve of what
you propose therein‚ being very delirous of
having your sentiments on any subjest.
Pere Malbranche's chapter of feei? ng all
³h33¹gs m G0d‚ was ever to me absolutely
unintelligible, and unless you think a po-
lemick discourse in your Effay (which you
have hitherto avoided therein) may not be
of a piece with the rest, Iam sure it highly
‘deserpves to be exposed, and is very agreea·
ble to the business of your work. I would
therefore humbly propose it to you, to con-
fider of doing something therein. Pere-
Malbranche has many Curious notione, and
some as erroneous and absurd, ’Tis a good
while since Ι read him, but Ι am now turo
ning him over a second time· he is mostly
Plagonick' and, in some thingS, almost enz-
thufiastical. lain, Honour’ddearSir‚
Your most obliged humble struant,

dear Friend,· which is most gtievous of all.
Yet Ι( hope it wll} be so but for a time3 for
if my'lord chaneellor comes: over in any
convenient s‘easo'nf2 ‚I will certa,inly·.get loose.
But thisssl 'canno't'hope for till the parlia-
ment sn Engla'nd fissi& I should be< glad to
kn'QJW' from youwhen that is'expeekd 3 for
indeed they bear ver, hard upo'nf us in Ire-

out our consewandreprefintatives, I leave
the, azichor of the ‘vnio' creatises quoverntnent
'to consider. But of this Ι [hall trouble you
far‘t'het an'othex time, fot you, will hear
more herea1⁴tet÷' . · ,
’ Ihave seen the ΒΡ. of Ψονζςίῖενέ answer to

-·-1 am very glad. Mons. Cqste is so well
setled as you tell me: I defign'd fully to
invite him over hither5 and if you know
any other ingenious French man of that
sort, or any such hereafter comes to your
knowledge, Ι should be very glad you
would give me intimation thereof. ’

Ι had certainly answer’d that part of
your letter relating to the lmen manufa-

S 4 sture,

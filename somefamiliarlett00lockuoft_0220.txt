ma dic mille hiens de ce lvsachematicien. le
along temps quemagna& praeclara minatur,
sans rie-77p7 oduir e que quelques demonstrations
decache‘es. Je croi 7zean777i077s qu'il ne vous
entend pu, Θ Je doure qu'il s entende bien

I see you and Ι, and this gentleman‚ a·
gree pretty w ell concen 1ing the 1n3113al]d
this sort o‘f fidling makes me hardly avold
thinking that he 18 not that very great man
as has been talked of him. His paper was
in England a year, or more, before lt w as
communicated to me, and I imagin you
u- ill think he need not make such a great
stir with it.

My EQ, you see, is transsatino into
Ε ench and 1t is by the same ΜΓ. Ceste a·
bove· mention'.d But this need not hinder
Mr. ffth7r7'clge in what he defigloed, for

nCoste goes on exceeding ssmvly, as Ι
im Ltold.

You see how forward Ι am to importune
{fou with all my little concernS. But this
would be nothing to what I should do if I
were nemer you, Ι should then be talking
to γοα de quolibet ente, and consulting you
about a thousand whimfies that come some·
times into mv thoughts. But with all this,
Ι unfeiqnedlx' am, Dear Sir,

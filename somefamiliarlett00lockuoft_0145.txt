iny minfd 6ν6ἷ since, 111131 Ib could scaffe drive
11 outo m t 1011 ns, 0 6 reveng on ou
therefore fiir poutting my hrains in such 3 {er-
· ment, I have resolved to be so impertinent
as to send you the result of my meditations
upon the subjecffi

The case is this A 111311 born perfeffl) blind
has 3 globe and 3 cube gi en 11110 his hands,
{ind instruued, as much as 116 15 capable of:
in 1116 11011011 o’f 63611 of these fifJ ἰς,11165 and 1116
difference betw een the1n.Let us now su} 1-
pose this 111311 suddenly to be endowed with
the sense of seeing, and the questionis, whe-
ther the globe and the cube being placed be
:fore his eyeS‚ 116 would be able, by his fight
alone, and without touching 1116111,10 1611
which was the globe, and w 111611 the cube.

For the better understanding of whatI
111311 say on this question, I defire you 10
take notice, 11131 Ι 6311 every notion of any
. thing which 3 111311 611161131115, 311 Idea·³ bu t
that 11011011 only v 111611 3 111311 entertains
of 3 v ifible thing, as it is 1161116, Ι 6311 311

Imqglciis being premised,1 lay down these

propofitions.
' 1. A man born blind may have 3 true

(tho’ perhaps 1101 3 perfe&> idea of 3 globe
and of 3 611116, and of some difference which

is between 1116111.

have so little love to controversy, that I am

not fully resolv'd. Some other additions I

have made, Ι hope will not displease you,

but Ι wish Ι could shew them you before-

they are in print·⁹ for I would not make

ffey book bigger‚ unless it were to make it
tter.

Ι τὴειῃκ you for advifing me of the error
about fight, for indeed it was a great one in
matter of fast, but it was in the‘expreffiorg
for I meanta minute, but, by mistake, call'd
rea-of a degree a second. Your ingenious
problem will deserve to be published to the
ivorld.

The seeming contradiction between what
is said p. 147. aud p, 341. is just as you take
it, and Ι hope so clearly expressed‚ that it'
cannot be mistaken, but by a very unwary
xeadeig who cannot distinguish between an
idea in the mind, and the real existence of
something out of the mind answering that
idea. But Ι heartily thank you for your
cantion, and (hall take care how to prevent
any such mistake when I come to that
place. My humble service to your brother⁶

,Ι am,
S I R,
Your most humble servam,

JoHN Locizss.

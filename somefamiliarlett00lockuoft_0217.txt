to you ‚ which 1 am now not sorry I did
not. Ι always value men of parts and
learning, and think I cannot do too much

me the encouragement of being concerned

age, Ι always fear whither it will lead a
man. I say this to you because you are my
friend for whom Ι have no reserveS, and
think 1 ought to talk freely where you en·
quire, and poffibly may be concerned3 but
I say it to you alone, and defire it may go
no farther. For the man Ι with very well,
and could give you, if it needed, proofs
that Ι do so· And therefore Ι defire you'
to be kind to him3 but I must leave it to·
your prudence‚ in what way, and how far.
If his. carriage with* you gives you the pro⁴
mises· of a steady useful man, 1 know you
will. be forward enough of your self‚ and Ι
{halt be very glad of it. For it will be his
fiult alone, if he prove not a ver)r valuable

man, and have not you for his friend.
Butl have so nething to say to you of
another man. Mons. Le Ubere, in almeri

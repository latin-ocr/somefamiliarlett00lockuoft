Bishop of-·--’s Letter to Mr. Motvmwx‘

S I R, Johnstowm Οὸἶ. 26. 1697.
Have met with Mr. Locke’s Rephz to the
bishop of W meister, and have had leis ure
to look it over here. I meddle not with the
controversy between them, but confess I
am a little snrpriz’d at what I find p. 95,
and 96. where we have these words: To
talk of the certainty of saith, seems all one
to me, as to talk os the knowledge of belie-
ving .· and, when it is brought to certainty,
saith is destroy'd .· and, bring it to certainty,
and it ceases to he saith. And he in terms
owns, p. 93. With me to know and to he cer⁹
min, is the same thina· what] know that Iam

certain ofi and what 152⁷} certain of, that Ι know.

And, p. 92. Knowledge Ι find in , my sels,
and I conceive in others, confisis in the per-
ception of the agreement or clisagreement of
the immediate objefi‘s of the mind in thinking,
which I call ideas. And, p. 8 3. Certainty
confisis in the perception of the agreement or
disagreement of two ideas, Now to me it
seeum, that according to Mr. Locke I cannot
be said to know any thing except there be
two ideas in my mind, and all the know-
‚lssdge Ihave must be coneerning the relation
these two ideas have to one another, and
that Ican be certain of nothing else·³ which,
ln my opinion, excludes all certainty of

R 3 sense

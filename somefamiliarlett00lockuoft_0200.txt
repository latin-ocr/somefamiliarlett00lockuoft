Honoured Sir, Dublin‚ April 6. 1697.

§N my last to you of March 16. there was·
3 passage relating to the author of Chri-

that he was so near me, 35, within the
bounds of this city·3 but Ι· find fince that 116

vour of 3 visit fiom 111111. I now under

born 111 this country5 but that? he has been
a great while abroad, an (1 1115 6(11163110111>ν35,
for some time, un'der the great Le Clerc.

100 much, is 1115 acquaintance and friendo
ship to you, and the respecst, which, on 311

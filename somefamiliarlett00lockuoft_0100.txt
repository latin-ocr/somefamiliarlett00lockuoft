fatigue was so troublesome to me, that 1
was quite discouraged from thinking of En·
gland that season. I have now had another
pull-back, by my present fickness, so that I
cannot yet well tell how to think of the o-
ther fide of the water. This only I will
assure you, that the first entire health God
is pleased to bestow on me, shall be em-
ploy’d in a journey towards you3 there be·
ing nothing, I so earnestly covet‚ as the
personal acquaintance of one for whom I
have so great a respe& and veneration‚ and
to whom Ι am so highly obliged for ma-
ny favourS.

There is a very worthy person, Dr. Sc..
George Afhe, Provost of the college here,
lately gone from hence to London3 he is a
great admirer, and zealous promoter of your
writings in his college. He defired from
me a letter of recommendation to you, but
1 fear your being in the country will hinder
his defigned happiness in your conversation,
He stays in London these three or four
months to come, in which time, if your
business call you to the city, you will hear
of him either at your lodging at Mr. Paw-
linge, ( where perhaps he will leave the
place of his refidence> or at Mr. Tuckers‚ in
the secretary’s office at Whicehaff‚ where a
penny-post letter will find him out.

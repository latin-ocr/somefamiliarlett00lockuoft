men. I am sorry it is s0, but Ι have of
late found it in several instances.

I hope, by this time, the second edition
of my book, which I ordered, for you, and
a printed copy of the additions are come to
your hands. I wish it were more answerao
ble to the value you place in it, and better
worth your acceptation. But, as I order
the matter, methinks I make it a hard bar-
gain to you, to pay so much time andpains
as must go to the reading it over, though
it were more ssightly than we seem agreed,
when you promise, and Ι expe& your obser-
vations on it. There appears to me so lit-
tle material‚ in the objetstions that I have
seen in print against me, that Ι have pas· ’
sed them all by, but' one Gentlernan’S,
whose book not coming to my hand till
those parts of mine were printed that he
questions, I was fain to put my answer in
the latter end of the epistle.

Iw1'ss1 the endeavours I have used to pro-
cure you a Tutor for your son, may be as
successful⁴ as Ι defire. ‚ ’Tis a business of
great concernment to both you and your
son 3 but governours ¹that have right
thoughts concerning education are hard to
be found. ’Tis happy for your son, that
a good part of it is to be under your eye,
I rhall be very glad, if in this or any other

I suppose you have land very proper to pro-
duce flax and hemp, why could not there
be enough, especially of the latter, produ-
ced there to supply his Majesty’s navy? I
would be obliged by your thoughts about
it, and how it might be brought about. Ι

quantity of hemp to be sown every year: if

w1thout any apology, Ι take this liberty
with you, 1 received an account of your
health, and your remembrance of me, not
long fince, by Mr. Howard, for which Ι

ὀ return you my thankS. Itroubled you with

a long letter about the beginning of the last

mouth, and am, SlR‚
Your most affeflionate, and

7110st humble servant,
M J. Loculi.

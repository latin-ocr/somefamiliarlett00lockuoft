I was so happy as 'to- see any of his wr'iae
ssssssffieiossfflffiffssff3332&ssss{3323
by presenting you one of my trifleS‚ which
I order’d my bookseller to lay before you
under this chamoter, As a mean testimorgy
of the great respecfi I had for the Auchor of
the Essay of Humane Understanding. And
fince Ι find by yours to me, that my am-
bition 'i‘s not fallen short of its design3 but
that you are pleased to encourage me by
affuring me that I have made great advan-
ces of friendship towards you·7 give me
leave to embrace the favour with all joy
imaginable. And that you may judge of
my fi-nce'rity by my open heart, Ι will
plainly 'confess to you ‚ that I have not in
my life read any book with more satisfa-
ἃίοῃ, than your fff‘ay5 insomuch that a
repeated perusal of it is still more pleasant
to me. ,

And I have endeavour’d ‚ with great
succes3‚ to recommend it to the *confi-
deration of the ingenious in this place.
Dr. King‚ Bishop of Derry, when he read
it ‚ made some ssight remarks on the fore·
most parts of the bo'ok·⁷ 'but his business
would not permit him to go through it aill.
What he did, rough as it wag, he gave to
me, and they are at your commandS, when
you please‚ O

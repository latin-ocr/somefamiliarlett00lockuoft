Ι hav e latelygot a little leisure to think of
some additions to my book, against the next
edition, and within these few days have
fallen upon a subjett that I know not how
far it will lead me. 1 have written several
pages on it, but the matter, the far-ther Ι
g0‚ opens the more upon me, and Ι cannot
yet get fight of any end of it. The title
of the chapter will be Of the Condztffl of the
Undetstap ling, which, if 1 shall pursue, as
far as 1 1mag1ne it will reach‚ and as it de-
serves, will, Iconclude, make the larg est
chapter of my Fffy. ’Tis well for you you
are not near me, 1 should be always pester-
ing you with my notionS‚ and paperS, and
reveries.1t would be a great happiness to
have a man of thought to lay them before,
{nd a friend that would deal candidly and
reely.

Ι hope, e'er thie, you and your brother
have receive ed printed copies of what the Dr.
communicated to the royal society. Ipre-
sume lt is publilh' d before this time, though
1 have not seen it, for Dr. Sloan writ me
word, some time sn ce, that it would be
speedily‚ and told me he would send it to
you And, if Mr. Clozirchill has taken that

care he promised me, l hope you have also
recen ed my le tter to the Bp. of Mnester,

3ἒά that 1 thr ll soon recene your thoughts
Ο it. -ν

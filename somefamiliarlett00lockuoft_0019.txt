an house, wherein it was not by some bo«
dy or other felt. We have news of it -at
several places from Cologn‚ as far as Bristol.
Whether it reach'd you I have not heard.
If it did, I would be glad to know what
was the exa& time it was felt, if any body
obser-ved it. By the Q1een’s pendulum at
Kenfington‚ which the lhake stop’d from go-
ing, it was 2 h. post m. At W hitehall, where
I observed it, it was by my warch 2 h.
5 m. post m. Which suppofing the Queen’s
pendulum went emet, and adding the εε-
quation of that day, it will fall near the
time marked by my watch, or a little la-
ter. If there could be found people that in
the whole extent of it did, by well adjust-
ed clocks exaffly observe the time ‚ one
might see whether it were all one shock,
or proceeded gradually from one place to a·
nother. ·

I thank you for having taken Dr. Sibeli·
us into your proteetion. I defire you, with
my service, to present my most humble thanks
to your brother for the favour of his let·
ter3 to which, though I have not time this
post, to return an answer‚ Ilhall not long
delay my acknowledgments.

’ Ι hope you will see, by the freedom I
have here taken with you, that I begin to
reckon my self amongst your acquaintance.

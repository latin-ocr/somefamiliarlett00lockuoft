&f a letter, writ lately to his corresponden't
here, o'ne ΜΓ. Βιινηεῑ, who sent it me late÷
ly, with a 'copy of ΜΓ. L 'S paper„
ΜΓ. Βιόνιεῑ has had it this year or tvm, but
hever com1minicated it, to me till about a
fortnigfit'ag0116. Ih'de'ed Mr. Cztmzingham pro-
'cured me a fight of it last summer, and he
and Ι read it paragraph by paragraph over
together, and he confeffed to me, that some
par'ts of it he did not understand-5 and 1
ihew’d him in others,‘ that ΜΓ. L '5
opinion would 'not' hold, who was perse&-
ly 'of my mind. q. I mention Mr. &mahg-
h'am to you3 ’ ifi' ffle‘case, because I think
hsim an extr'a'o‘rdinary 111311 of parts and
lea'rfiing, and 116 is 6116 that {s known to

his in the ac‘z‘a eruditorum, Which he quotes,
and lhave fince read, and had ju'st t'h'e same
thoughts of it, when} read it, as I find you‘
have. Frdm whence I only draw² this in-

late book ofFevers‚ having not read it my
self‚ nor heard lt spoke of by others: Butl

perfeffly auree with you concerning general
theories, that they are for the 11101ὶὸ part but
a sort of waking dreatn5‚ with which when
men have warm’d their own heads‚ they
pass into unquestionable 11111115, and then
the ignorant uorld must be set rioht by
them. Tho’ this be, as you rightly ob-
16116, beginning at 1116 w 101111,Γ end, when
men iay the foundation 1n their own phan-
fies, and then endeavour to sute the phaeno-
mena of diseases‚ and the cure of them, to
those phanfieS. Ι wonder that, after the
pattern Dr. Sydenham has set them of a
better way ‚ men should return again to
that romance way of phyfick. But Ι see it'
is eafier and more natural for men to build
castles 111 the alr of their own, than to sur·
vey well those that are to be found stand-
ing. Nicely to observe the history of disea-
ses in all their changes and circumstances,

and judoment· and xx 11616111 if 111611,11110’
prepoffeffion or oscitancy mistake‚ they may
be 6011 x inced of their error by unerring na-
ture and matter of fa& w 111611 leav 65 less 100111
for the subtletys‘ nd difpnte of words which
serves very 11111611 instead of knowledge in
the learned world, where methinks wit and
invention has much the preference to truth.

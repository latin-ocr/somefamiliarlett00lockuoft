see subjests enough which way ever I cast
my eyeS, that deserve to be otherwise hand-
led, than Ι imagine they have been3 but
they require abler headS, and stronger bo-
dies than Ihave‚ to manage them. Befidw,
when Ireflec‘t on what I have done, I won-
der at rny own bold folly‚ that has so far
exposed me in this nice and critical, as well
as quickfighted and learned age. I say not
this to excuse a lazy idleness‚ to which I
:intend to give up the rest of my few days,
I think every one, according to what way
providence has placed him in, is bound to
labour for the publick good, as far as he is
able, or else he has no right to eat. Under
this obligation of doing something, Ι can-
not have a stronger to determine me what I
shall do, than what your defires shall engage
me in. I know not whether the attempt
will etzceed my strength. But there being
several here who joyn with you to press me
to it3 (Ι received a letter with the same in-
stance, from two of my friends at Lmzdmz‚
the last post) I think, the first leisure I can
get to my self‚ I shall apply my thoughts
to it3 and however I may miss my aim,
will justifie my self in my obedience to you,
and some others of my ingenious friends,

Iam

the correfflons you have sent me, which I·
will take 311 1116 care of I 6311 111 1116 next
edition, which, my bookseller tells 1116, 116
thinks will be this summer. And if any
other 1311 under your observatum, I shall
desire the continuance of your favour in
communicating them.

Ι must own 10 you, 11131 I have been
solicited from beyond 163 10 put my Effay
into latin, but you guess right, I have not
the leisure to 110 it. It was once transsated
by a young man in Holland‚ into latin, but
he was so little master of the english or 13-
1111 10118116, 11131 when it was {hew’d me,
which 116 did not 1111 11611311 quite done it,
Ι satisfyed 111111 11131 11 would be very 111116
for his credit to publish it, 31111 10 11131 was
laid by. Since that, my bookseller wa8,
and had been for some time, seeking for a
transsator, whom he would have treated
with to have undertaken 11, 31111 have satis-
fyed for his 1131115. But 3 111116 before the
coming of your letter, he writ me word he
had been disappointed where he 61111661611 10
have found 0116 who would have done 11,
31111 was now 31 3 loss. So 11131 what you
call 3 110111, is not only 1116 kindest, but the
most 163101131116 1110110131 you could have
made. You understand m'y thoughts as
well as Ido my 1611, and 6311 be 3 fit judge
whether the transsator 1135 expreffed 111611ιί

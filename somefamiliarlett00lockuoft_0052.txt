Mr. MOLYNEUX to Mr. Loexss.

51 R , mmm, Apr.18. 1693.
Have lately received farther testimonies
of your kindness and friendlhipto me

in your last of march 28. which brings with-
al the welcome news of your having com·
mitted your work of education to the press3
than which, 1 know not any thing tha't I
ever expeeled with a more earnest delire.
What my brother told me, relating to that
treatise, he had from your self in Hellands,
but perhaps you might have forgot‘what
pass’d between you on that occation. = I
perceive you fear the novelty of some no-
tions therein may seem extravagant3 but,
if I may venture to judge of the author, I
fear no such thing from him. Ι doubt
not, but the work will be new and peculias,
as his other performanees3 and this ’tis that
renders them estimable and pleasant. He
that tra-cels the beaten roads may chance
indeed to have company3 but he that takes
his liberty, and manages it with judgmenq
is the man that. makes useful discoverieS,
and most beneficial to those that follow him.
Had Columbm never ve'ntur’d farther than
his predecefl'om, we had yet been ignorant

of a vast part of our earth, preferables (as

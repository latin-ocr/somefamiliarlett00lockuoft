Dr. MOLYNEUX to Mr. Locxt.

S Ι R, > Duum, Nov-q. 1693. x
FOR a while I defer'd making any re

turn 'for the favour of your last let-
ter, on the account I understood by one of
yours to my brother, that I was suddenly
to expe& another obl’igation srom you, by
the receipt of your treatise of Education,
which yesterday first came to my hands3 and
now I return you my hearty thanks for
both your kindne ffes together,⁴ of which
should 1 express the real thoughts Ι have, I
would seem to run either mto extravagant
compl-emens, or grossflattery. · But thus much
Ι must need} say,· that as your letter εετὲ
tainly contains m short the only true me-
’ rhod 'for the prosecuting the curtng part of
the praefice of ph) fick‚ aud the sure vray
of unprovmg itg a matter of the chiefest
good m relation to mens bodies: so your
book of Edioeation lay s dow n such rules for
the breeding of youth, aS, if follow’d, must
neeeffarily prove of the greatest advantage
ro the better part of man, the mind· by
insensibly dispofing it to an habitual exer-
cise of what ιε vertuous and laudable‚ and
the acquisition of all sucu knowledge as is
‘necess‘ary forv one's own good, or that⁴ of
others whom 'we are to com-erse with.

Both W hgston and Bentley are pofitive a?
gafmst the idea of God being innate-³ and I
had rather rely on them <if I would rely
on any man) than on Dr. S-——. 'Tis true,
the latter has a great namez, but that, Ἰ am
sure, weighs not with you or me. Befides,
you rightly observe, the Dr. is no obstinate
heretick, but may veer about when another
opinion comes in fafhiou3 for some men al-
ter their notions as they do their cloathS,
in complyance to the mode. I have heard
of a master of the Temple, who, during the
fiege of Limerick‚ w‘ri't over hither to a
certain prelate, to be sure to let him knowr,
by the first opportunity, whenever it came
to be surrender'd, which was done accord-
ingly3 and immediately the good Dr.³s eyes
were opened‚ and he plainly saw the ‚oaths
to K. W illiam and Q, Mary were not only
expedient but lawful, and our duty. Α
good roaring train of artillery is not only'
the ratio ultima regum, but of other men

some men find mischievous in your Effayg
‘ffTis opening the eyes ‚of the ignorant, and
refiifying the methods of reasoning, which
‘perhaps may undermine some received ere¹
gorg„ and so abridge the empire of darkness3

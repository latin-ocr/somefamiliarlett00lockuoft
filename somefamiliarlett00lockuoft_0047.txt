Mr. Locxss to Mr. Momm-mx.

⁵ SIR, standon, 28. Mar. 1693.·

Our filence that spared me a great

. deal of fear and uneafiness‚ by con-
cealing from me your fickness till it was
well over, is abundantly made amends for
by the joy it brings me in the news of your
recovery. You have given me those marks
of your kindness to me, that you will not
think it strange that Ι count you amongst
ffJef‘ussfissdffissssssclz affidhssssll'osfssss &2533ngss
confidence ‚ I never accuse them to my
self of neglest or coldness, when Ι fail to
hear from them so soon as I expeeted or de-
fired: though had Ι known you so well be·-
fore as I do now, fince your last letter, Ι
should not have avoided being in pain upon
account of your health.

I cannot at all doubt the fincerity of any
thing you say to me3 but yet give ine leave
to think, that 'tis an excess of kindness a·
lone could excuse it from looking like com-
plement. But Ιι am convinced you love
your friends extremely, where you have
made choice of them, and then believe you

⁴ can never think nor speak too well of them„

I know not whether it llnglongs to a mein]

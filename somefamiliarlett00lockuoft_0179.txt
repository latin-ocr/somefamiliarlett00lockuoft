have lately received a letter from Mr. Hom-
ard, that obliges me to make his acknow·
'ledgments for the favours he has received
from you, This I can hardly d0‚ without
complaining of him at the same time, for
not yet sending me your pic‘iure3 but Ι sup-
pose, by this time, ’tis on the road hither,
and Iforgive him 3 and, with all gratitude
imaginable, return you my thanks on his
account.

The inclosed piece of natural history, I
am desired by my brother to present to you,
with his most affectionate humble service.
lf, upon perufing it, you think it may de-
serve it, you may send it by the penny-post
to the royal society, to fill up an empty
page in the transactione. There is nothing
to recommend it but its being exaffly true,
and an account of a non—descript animal.
Formerly 1 had a constant correspondence
with the secretary of the society, but of late
it has fail’d3 and therefore we take the li-
berty of sending this through your hands,

I have lately met a book here of Mons. Le
Clerc's, call’d The . Causes of Incredzdity‚
done out of French. ’Tis the same Le Clerc
, that writes Ontologz'a, and dedicates it to you.
I find thereby you are his acquaintance and
friendz, Iffiould be very glad you would be
pleased to give mc some account of that
gentleman 2 and his circumstances in the

world²

’ ’ Is a melancholly thought tome, that

³ fince I have had the happiness of
your correspondence, there has hardly hap-
pe‘n'd a year, when both you and I have
not made it an apology for our long filence‚
that we have been indispos ed in our health3
yet it has pleased G0d‚ that so it has been,
and so it is on my fide at present. About
four years and an half ago Ι was first seized
by a v'iolent cholick‚ which then so wea-
ken’d me, that, to this time, I lye so
‘far under the effefis thereof, as upon any
cold to be very apt to relapse into the same.
And so· it has been with me for a while past,
but now, God be thanked, Iam again well

recover'd. I had not otherwise so longde}

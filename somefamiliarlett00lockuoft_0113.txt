This encourages me, with more vigour,
to promote the transsation of your work,
and to own my self infinitely obliged to
you, that you are pleased so readily to com·
ply with the offer Ι made you in my last.
Yesterday Ι sent for an ingenious young
man of the college here, to discourse with
him about it. The result was, he would
make an effay‚ and shew‘it me, and accor-
dingly would proceed or defist. But then,
he tells me that he cannot set himself fully
to it till towards the latter end of Mfyf3 for
he defigns to stand candidate for a fellow·
ship in the college, which, by the removal
of the Provost, is to be disposed of about
next 'Dinizjy—Szmday3 and, in the mean
time, he is to prepare himself sor the exami-
nation they undergo on that occasion. Ι
shall see his first attempt the next week,
and shall give you an account. As to any
alterations to be made by me, I should be
very cautious of medling therein3 I know

1 the whole work has already undergone so

exact a judgment, there is no room left sor

ζ amendmentS. However‚ if any such offer,

ξ after your approbation of them, I should
venture to insert them.

ἓ - Ι must freely confesS, that if my notion
1 of Enthztfiafin agrees with yours, there is no

Ἰ necessity of adding any thing concerning it„
- more than by the by, and in a single fection

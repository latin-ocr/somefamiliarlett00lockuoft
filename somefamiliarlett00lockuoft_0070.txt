can be suspended from determining the will
tso any subs ervient assion, till we have ma-
turely examin'd whether the particular ap*

our real happiness ‚ or be consistent or in*
consistent with it. The result os our judg-
ment, upon examination‚ is what ultimate-

fiee, if his will were determin’d by any
thing but his own desire, or guided by hisv
own judgment. This, in short, is what I·
think of this matter, I defire you to exa-
mine it by your own thoughts.¹> I think I

you are ill, I should know the worst of it.
This has so wholly taken up my mind at
present, that Ihave no inclination to write
one word more to you in this3 but again
to repeat my request to you, that you would
let me know how you are·³ for till Ι know
this, I am diffatisfy’d‚ I am extremely uno
easy 3 but for ever shall be

Your most [gffefi‘ionate admirer,

Mr. LocKE to Mr. MoLYNEUx.

Dear Sir, Oates‚ 10 Jan. 169}
Our gentle and kind reproof of my

. filence has greater marks of true
friendship in it, than can be express’d in the
most elaborate professions‚ or be sufficiently
a'cknowledg'd bya man who has not the op-
portunity nor ability to make those returns '
he would. Tho' Ι have had less health
. and more business since Iwrit to you last
than ever I had for so long together in my

life·
